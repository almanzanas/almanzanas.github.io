    "text": "Campaign Acceptance Prediction (iFood)\nThis project focuses on a company in the food retail sector that aims to maximize their next marketing campaign and to do so, they are handing over their pilot study data. This will involve cleaning the data, analyzing it and proposing an approach to the marketing team to achieve this improvement for the next campaign. The second part focuses on getting a model that predicts customer behavior and thus selecting the most suitable customers for the next campaign.\n\nRepository\n\n\nOverview\n\nDescriptive StatisticsBar chart for categorical variableCorrelation MatrixLearning CurveFeature Importance\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\n\nTable showing descriptive statistics for each selected quantitative variable. Several of these statistics have been calculated with custom functions such as ‘Winsorised Mean’, ‘Coefficient of Variation Centered on the Mean’ or ‘Trimmed Mean’.\n\n\n\n\n\nBar Char\n\n\nThis graph, composed of six vertical bar charts with confidence interval, shows the mean values of amount of money spent by product type for the Marital Status categories.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\n\n\nThe visualization represents a heat map with the correlations between the selected quantitative variables in order to observe the relationships between these variables and to guide further analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision Tree Learning Curve\n\n\nThe learning curve shows how the error decreases as we increase the size of the training set. It also helps us to identify whether our model is under-fitting or over-fitting the data. It is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a model.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Importance in Random Forest model\n\n\nThis bar chart represents the importance of the features for the first decision tree in the Random Forest prediction model. It provides information about the relative importance of each feature (or variable) in the decision tree, useful for understanding which features most influence the model’s predictions."

I take care to maintain a scientific basis for the whole process, be it data cleaning, descriptive, inferential and predictive analysis. To learn the basics of different tools and languages, I have used, among others, the following books:\n\nMatthes, E. (2023). Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition. No Starch Press.\nMcKinney, W. (2022). Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and Jupyter. O’Reilly Media.\nArnold, J. (2023). Learning Microsoft Power Bi: Transforming Data Into Insights. O’Reilly Media.\n\nBelow I highlight some image with a small description so you can get the idea, but I encourage you to explore the repository, there is all the content I have gone through.\n\nRepository\n\n\nOverview\n\nDashboard sociodemographicDashboard Grade History\n\n\n\n\n\nSociodemographic data of university degree\n\n\nThe image shows a dashboard developed with Power BI in which you can see different graphs and data on how students are distributed throughout a course. From the number of students in the classroom, to a map showing the average scores depending on the state of residence in the USA.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrades data of university degree\n\n\nThis is also a Power BI dashboard in which the same data has been used, but this time it focuses on the grades obtained by the students. We can see what kind of test they had, how they describe their own level in Excel, as well as the average grade and what grade it corresponds to."
