It explains in a visual way the decisions that must be made to achieve high productivity. The most direct branch indicates that, when 'targeted_productivity' is '0.75' or '0.80' and 'incentive' is greater than 70, the predicted productivity would be 0.913 (1 being the maximum).\n\n#### Random Forest\n\n![Random Forst's AUC](images/prodct/01.png)\n\nROC curve plot with the AUC parameter at the bottom. It indicates how well the Random Forest classification model differentiates the categories. The larger the area under the curve with a maximum of 1, the better the predictions.\n\n#### Group Comparisons\n\n![Teams with high vs low productivity](images/prodct/00.png)\n\nTwo statistically significant Wilcoxon comparisons can be seen. The visualization is in ggplot2 with the extension ggpubr. It shows how the work teams that are less compliant with productivity have a statistically lower incentive and the number of changes in their production process is statistically higher than the work teams that do meet the target productivity.\n\n#### Classification\n\n|                    | Random Forest | MC-RF | Logistic Regression | SVM   |\n|--------------------|:--------------|:------|:--------------------|:------|\n| **Accuracy**       | 0.803         | 0.798 | 0.741               | 0.735 |\n| **Recall**         | 0.902         | 0.902 | 0.887               | 0.971 |\n| **Precision**      | 0.839         | 0.834 | 0.789               | 0.743 |\n| **Kappa**          | 0.47          | 0.455 | 0.237               | 0.106 |\n| **Detection Rate** | 0.655         | 0.655 | 0.657               | 0.706 |\n| **AUC**            | 0.816         | 0.832 |                     | 0.672 |\n\n#### Regression\n\n|                     | R\\^2   | RMSE   | MSE     | MAE     |\n|---------------------|:-------|:-------|:--------|:--------|\n| **Stepwise** \\*     | 0.300  |        |         |         |\n| **LR Multiple** \\*  | 0.247  | 0.150  | 0.0226  | 0.1088  |\n| **Robust LR**       | 0.213  | 0.1499 | 0.02247 | 0.1066  |\n| **RF Regression**   | 0.4193 | 0.1288 | 0.01658 | 0.08681 |\n| **Regression Tree** | 0.4403 | 0.1369 | 0.01875 | 0.09652 |\n| **Cubist Tree** \\*  | 0.3902 | 0.132  | 0.01741 | 0.08411 |\n:::\n\n## Campaign Acceptance Prediction (iFood) {.unnumbered}\n\nThis project focuses on a company in the food retail sector that aims to maximize their next marketing campaign and to do so, they are handing over their pilot study data.
